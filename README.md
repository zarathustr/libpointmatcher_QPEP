# Documentation and Tutorials

libpointmatcher is a modular library implementing the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for aligning point clouds. It has applications in robotics and computer vision.
The library is written in C++ for effeciency with [bindings in Python](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/blob/master/doc/index.md#python-).

**Quick link for the tutorial pages: [Tutorials](doc/index.md) (also available on [readthedocs.org](http://libpointmatcher.readthedocs.org/)).**

Those tutorials are written using Markdown syntax and stored in the project's `/doc` folder.  Their scope ranges from introductory material on performing point cloud registration to instructions for the more experienced developer on how to extend the library's codebase. 

Libpointmatcher's source code is fully documented based on doxygen to provide an easy API to developers. An example of this API can be found [here](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/libpointmatcher-doc/), but it is suggested to use the one build for your version in `doc/html`. 

libpointmatcher is being developed by [François Pomerleau](mailto:f.pomerleau@gmail.com) and [Stéphane Magnenat](http://stephane.magnenat.net) as part of our work at [ASL-ETH](http://www.asl.ethz.ch).

You can read the latest changes in the [release notes](doc/ReleaseNotes.md).

# Quick Start

Although we suggest to use the [tutorials](doc/index.md), here is a quick version of it:

The library has a light dependency list:

 * [Eigen] version 3, a modern C++ matrix and linear-algebra library,
 * [boost] version 1.48 and up, portable C++ source libraries,
 * [libnabo] version 1.0.7, a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces,
 
and was compiled on:
  * Ubuntu ([see how](/doc/CompilationUbuntu.md))
  * Mac OS X ([see how](/doc/CompilationMac.md))
  * Windows ([see how](/doc/CompilationWindows.md) - partially supported)

### Compilation & Installation 

For beginner users who are not familiar with compiling and installing a library in Linux, go [here](doc/CompilationUbuntu.md) for detailed instructions on how to compile libpointmatcher from the source code.  If you are comfortable with Linux and CMake and have already installed the prerequisites above, the following commands should install libpointmatcher on your system.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Testing

Libpointmatcher ships with a version of the Google testing framework [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).  Unit tests are located in the `utest/` directory and are compiled with libpointmatcher (CMake variable `BUILD_TESTS` must be set to `TRUE` before compiling).  To run the tests and make sure that your compiled version is working correctly, run the test executable in your build directory:

```bash
cd build
utest/utest --path ../examples/data/
```

### Linking to external projects.

We mainly develop for __cmake projects__ and we provide example files under [`examples/demo_cmake/`](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/tree/master/examples/demo_cmake) to help you in your own project. We also provide a __QT Creator__ example in [`examples/demo_QT/`](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/tree/master/examples/demo_Qt), which manually list all the dependencies in the file [`demo.pro`](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/blob/master/examples/demo_Qt/demo.pro). You would need to ajust those paths to point at the appropriate locations on your system. For a more detailled procedure, check the [Linking Projects to libpointmatcher](doc/LinkingProjects.md) section.


### Bug reporting

Please use our [github's issue tracker](http://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/issues) to report bugs. If you are running the library on Ubuntu, copy-paste the output of the script [listVersionsUbuntu.sh](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/blob/master/utest/listVersionsUbuntu.sh) to simplify the search of an answer.

## File formats
The library support different file formats for importing or exporting data:
  * csv (Comma Separated Values)
  * vtk (Visualization Toolkit Files)
  * ply (Polygon File Format)
  * pcd (Point Cloud Library Format)

Those functionnalities are available without increasing the list of dependencies at the expense of a limited functionality support. For more details, see the tutorial [Importing and Exporting Point Clouds](doc/ImportExport.md). Example executables using those file formats from the command line can be found in the `/examples` directory and are described [here](doc/ICPIntro.md) in more details.

# Extra Reading

If you are interested in learning more about different registration algorithms, we recently put together a literature review surveying multiple solutions. The review is organized in the same way as the library and many examples are provided based on real deployments.

# More Point Clouds

We also produced those freely available data sets to test different registration solutions:

[_Challenging data sets for point cloud registration algorithms_](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=laserregistration:laserregistration)

![alt tag](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&media=laserregistration:asldataset_weblarge.jpg)

You can download the files in CSV or VTK formats, which are directly supported by the library I/O module.
